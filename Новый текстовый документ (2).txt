eye-catching answer while recently discussing his dream fight while speaking on an episode of the disruptors he indicated that he wants to fight at anfield stadium specifically Nam dropping Conor McGregor probably you'd have to say Conor cuz he McGregor cuz you get paid more than fighting anyone else by fighting him yeah wouldn't want to give too much away no obviously he's a striker put him on his back and try and submit him I reckon a lot of people would want that fight he might do you'll see you in the
00:56
future you never know although odds are that a fight between the two isn't in the cards right now as the baddy indicated anything can happen however with McGregor having just two fights left on his contract and one of those fights expected to be Michael Chandler piml let's window may be closing next up let's take a look at Alaine Sterling calls out sha Ali in the main event of UFC 299 sugar Shan Ali picked up his first title defense and Avenged the lone loss of his career by defeating Marlon Chito Vera in the wake of the fight om
01:24
Ali found himself in a back and forth with former Champion aljamain Sterling on Twitter after the former champion question why the fight was made in the first place given the bantamweight rankings while Sterling gave om Ali his credit for the win the way he saw things om Ali was expected to win the fight all along and should have been defending the belt against a top ranked contender in a video for his YouTube channel Sterling once again weighed in on the bout the only thing that rubbed me the wrong way a little bit again and you could call me
01:51
salty about it you could call me a hater but I stick up for my boys and I hope you guys do too but he should have called out Mor Rob and did the right thing um I think it's kind of ridiculous for him to say Dana get the jet to Spain like what are you talking about dude you defended the belt against a guy who was even ranked in the top five they moved him up to the top five to make it look like it was better like he fought a top five opponent how did Cheeto move up in the ranking who did he beat to move up
02:14
in the ranking he just barely beat Pedro Munoz it's important to note that om Ali has since indicated his desire to defend the title against morav de V suggesting that the two headlined the upcoming UFC 306 card at the Vegas sphere in September next up let's take a look at Ian Gary versus Michael Venom pagee next after a big win in his UFC debut Michael page has continued to find his name in talks alongside a number of potential welterweight opponents although he indicated following the victory over
02:44
Holland that he has no intentions of calling anyone out fans suggested a matchup between he and Steven Wonderboy Thompson after MVP pumped the brakes on that fight Michael Bisping has now thrown out another name Ian Gary he spoke in a recent video for his YouTube channel about the bout and the welterweight division is is spicing up in a big big way Ian Mardo Gary is at number six I think you leite frog Michael pige right up to a number six fight with Ian Mardo Gary and I'm just saying as a fan right I would love to
03:16
see that fight they're both very tall Ian is 63 Michael Paige is 63 they're both Strikers they're not going to wrestle we're going to see two tremendously talented Strikers throwing down and it would be a lot of fun and the winner of that fight between Michael pige and Ian Gary po then would get to fight Leon Edwards in a stadium in the UK could you imagine that despite page indicating that about between he and Thompson may not be the most exciting given their similarities as counter punchers Alaine Sterling still wants to
03:44
see the fight he spoke in a video for his YouTube channel how do you fight this guy how do you fight Michael Venom paig you go in damned if you do you pull back and you stand there damned if you don't so if you stand there you give him an opportunity to use and setle like his his footwork his bounce his rhythm his off step stuff and then he's got both hands he's looking away he's looking down he's showing his legs and then he's coming back with these darting punches and then you run in and he's backing up
04:10
he's sliding and every time you try to step in you try to Blitz he counters you or he's out of there nowhere to be found that's a dangerous guy to fight so far no word yet as to when MVP will look to return to the Octagon next let's take a look at Islam makach fires back at Charles Oliva comment in the wake of Dustin pore's win over Ben wasand den and the co co- main event of UFC 299 the former interim lightweight champ now finds himself in a position to compete against Islam makev this summer while
04:37
many of question why porier should get to jump the line when there are other contenders waiting for their shot with Charles Oliva Armen cukan and Justin gagei all booked for UFC 300 fights none of the other top rank contenders will be in a position to fight early this summer on makach chev's timeline after a recent post on Instagram showing himself alongside Dana White which the champ captioned Dana I got hungry feed me someone a fan wrote in the comments the champ has a name along with a series of Brazilian Flags makev himself then
05:07
responded writing champ have belt so far a fight between makev and porier has not been finalized however given that no other top rank Contender is available about between the two makes sense with the winner then fighting one of the three lightweight contenders mentioned previously towards the end of the year this would not only keep the division moving along but also follow the timeline given by makev on social media recently where he indicated his desire to fight this summer at the end of the year and then in early 2025 now let's

08:00
while the promotion would prefer to stay with ESPN and Disney Dana White heaped Praise on Netflix during the UFC 299 postf fight press conference following the company's deal with the WWE I think the Netflix should have gotten the live sports years ago I think I think they're they're uh they're they're late to the game but they are a force they're a force man and and when you look at um the amount of homes that they're in worldwide as all these massive streaming companies start to get bigger and bigger
